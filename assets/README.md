## My process

I started a React App with creact-react-app and divided the site into components: Menu for the navigation, Section for the cards in the main section, Testimonials, Gallery and Footer. I used Sass to compile my CSS so built several mixin's and variables. I also read Andy Bell's website about his CUBE CSS methodology and watch Youtube video's to get acquainted. I tried to use this methodology and divided my style sheets into Components, Utilities, Blocks and Exceptions.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi) - CUBE CSS documentation
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - Sass documentation


### What I learned

I improved my knowledge of CSS grid and responsive design. I tried to make the site responsive and fluid without using media queries. I built the site in React to improve my skills, but in retrospect the interactive elements in the site were too limited to take advantage of React's benefits. My first time to use Sass taught me how strong and diverse Sass is for compiling CSS. I learned the basics and plan to extend my knowledge. I liked CUBE CSS because it considers the cascading and specificity of CSS as its stength, but I did have difficulty implementing it. 

At the end I added the active states which presented a challenge to change the color of the social media icons when you hover over them. It was the first time I altered SVG-files.

### Continued development

Extend my knowledge of HTML, CSS and React. I plan to continue with Sass and will try to combine CUBE and BEM.
